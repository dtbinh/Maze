# Maze
University Year 3, Final year project

This project aims to create a first person shooting game based on Artificial Intelligence (AI). The idea is to make a maze game and implement intelligence tothe enemies in the maze to fight against the player. Therefore, the player will not only exploring inside the maze, but also facing various enemies with sophisticated characteristics.

This is the ideology the project will instil, creating an agent which is cunningly smart, where the player’s aim must be to outsmart it in order to reach the golden objective, the treasures in order to win the game. The agent’s aim is to hunt the player, in terms of AI capabilities, the agent will utilise a sense think act methodology in which the agent will constantly scan the maze in hunt for the player. The agent will get closer and closer until either the agent find the player or the player runs into the agent.

The maze will be constructed randomly, in which the structure of the game will be different in every different rounds. The level itself will consist of objects which the player can pick up in order to gain extra health or power up. However, if a player’s health runs out then the game will over. The player can collect objects which will be randomly generated and randomly placed across the maze, they could potentially use some objects to aid their success in out smarting the agent and find the treasures hidden somewhere within the maze.

This project will fully utilise the intelligence of agents and is going to be huge logically and in terms of complexity. However, it will be a fun and a rather sophisticated project in terms of learning the reaction of an AI when it is being out witted by a player.
